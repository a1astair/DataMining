1.  Are you planning to predict the winner for each game?

2.  If so, you can consider each of the  games to be two training 
    instances (one per team) and the prediction is win/loss.

3.  Think of what you should do if the prediction is lose (or win)
    for both teams.

4.  Also, you can’t use the goals scored as a feature for predicting 
    the winner - since it would tell you the answer, no?

5.  You might consider using the features from previous games to help 
    boost your accuracy.

6.  You could use the number of goals scored in the previous 5 games, 
    and the number of wins in the previous 5 games, or something like that.

7.  I’m a little worried that without using historical data you might 
    not have enough information to predict the outcome of a 
    particular game. What will you compare against?

8.  How well can you do over an “algorithm” that just predicts 
    whatever the outcome was the last time the two teams met?

9.  Or one that always predicts the home team will win?

10. By the midterm report I expect you to have your data creation 
    done and a naive algorithm implemented (consider the two examples above).
